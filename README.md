# It's a MEN full-stack crud with referenced data app that allows users to share and favorite/unfavorite each other's recipes after creating an account. Users can also delete/edit/update their own posted recipes.

# Attributions: 
- I used the docs and open-house level-up with chat-GPT for debugging.

# Tech used:
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Node.js
- EJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose


# Next steps: 
- Incorporate an API, users could be able to submit pictures and videos with their recipe, and rotating recipes of the week on the front page
